# segmented

a mod that splits your hotbar into 3 segments, and removes the need to move your hand multiple miles every time you want to hotkey to later slots. <br>
the way it works is instead of using keys 1-9 to select a slot, you first select a segment using 1-3, and then select a slot in that segment using 1-3 again. <br>
this makes it possible to quickly navigate the hotbar without ever moving your hand.

the mod is available for Fabric. no Forge support is planned, please don't ask for it. <br>
you can disable the mod through [ModMenu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu), if needed.
