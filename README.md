# segmented


A mod that splits your hotbar into 3 segments, and removes the need to move your hand multiple miles every time you want to hotkey to later slots. <br>
The way it works is instead of using keys 1-9 to select a slot, you first select a segment using 1-3, and then select a slot in that segment using 1-3 again. This makes it possible to quickly navigate the hotbar without ever moving your hand.

Segmented is available for Fabric, currently only for 1.19.4, although all 1.19 versions are planned. <br>
No Forge support is planned, and please don't ask for it. <br>

The mod requires [Cloth Config](https://github.com/shedaniel/ClothConfig/) and [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric), and you can toggle features of the mod through [ModMenu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu), if needed.
